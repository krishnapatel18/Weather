# For Weatherv1.0
This file contains my first program, In which I used a weather API call to retrieve weather information and provided manual dietary suggestions based on the weather.

_**INSTRUCTIONS:**_

-> To execute this code first you need to give **your API key** as value for **weather_api_key**. Note that I have used api from 'openweathermap.org'.

-> If you encounter **ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'requests'** error, You need to install requests module. You can do it by running **pip install requests** command in your Terminal.

-> To get information of your desired city you can change value of **city_id**.

  { To find a _city ID_ in the OpenWeatherMap API, you can:
  
  Step 1: Go to openweathermap.org
  
  Step 2: Enter the name of the desired city or town in the search field
  
  Step 3: Click the Search button
  
  Step 4: Find your city in the results and click on its name
  
  Step 5: The city ID will be in your browser's address bar }

_**INSTRUCTIONS:**_

-> To execute this code first you need to replace **your API key** as value for **weather_api_key** and **nutrition_api_key**. Note that I have used api from 'openweathermap.org' to fetch weather information and api from 'edamam.com' to fetch recipe suggestions.

-> If you encounter **ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'requests'** error, You need to install requests module. You can do it by running **pip install requests** command in your Terminal.
